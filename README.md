<h1>Vulnerability Scanner Deployment Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves deploying the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner within a VirtualBox virtual machine on a host system running Windows 10. The purpose of this deployment is to create a controlled environment for scanning and identifying potential vulnerabilities within a network or system. Throughout the project, best practices for security and ethical use of vulnerability scanning tools will be adhered to. Additionally, considerations for network and system performance will be taken into account to ensure the scanning process does not disrupt the host or other networked devices.

The project aims to provide hands-on experience with deploying and using a vulnerability scanner in a virtualized environment, while also gaining insight into the importance of identifying and addressing potential security risks.

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Virtual Box</b> 
- <b>Nessus</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
Create a new virtual machine within VirtualBox and configure the necessary settings such as memory, CPU, and network adapters: <br/>

<br />
In this section, we will outline the essential procedures for preparing your virtual machine (VM) for scanning. This involves optimizing security updates, installing all available updates, and disabling the firewall. These measures are critical to ensure that Nessus can effectively identify any vulnerabilities or weaknesses: <br/>

<br />
<br />
We must ensure that the virtual machine is on the same network as the machine that will be conducting the scan. Navigate to the network adapter option and select "attach to host" on the adapter, we encounter some problems with dhcp server which was off so we eneable it in File > Tools > Network Manager. Now we can ping our virtual machine from host: <br/>

<br />
<br />
After the successful configuration of our Windows machine, we are prepared to proceed with the download and installation of Nessus. Upon entering the required information and activation code, we will wait for the installation process to be finalized:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next step after successful installation and compilation of plugins, it is time to configure our first scan. From the various options available in Nessus, we will select the basic network scan and configure the name and IP address of our VM with basic settings. While we wait for scan to finish we can observ informations about scan as we can see we Scan already detected one mediom Vulnerabilitie   <br/>

<br />
To conduct a more thorough analysis, you can click on the blue bar beneath the vulnerabilities to access comprehensive details. These vulnerabilities are categorized into different sections based on technology and relevance, facilitating easy navigation through the findings.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Upon selecting the medium vulnerability, Nessus provides detailed information regarding the identified vulnerability. For instance, that SMB Signing is not required, which can be exploited by attackers through man-in-the-middle attacks against the SMB server. Additionally, Nessus offers a solution to address this issue under the "Solution" section.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Let's proceed to the next phase by incorporating credentials into our saved Windows scan to gain more detailed information. Begin by accessing "My Scans" and selecting the saved scan, labeled "first." In the top-right corner, you will find an option to configure. Click on this to proceed. In the credentials section, choose "Windows" as our VM is Windows-based. When conducting a Windows credentials scan, various authentication methods are available, including password, Kerberos, hash, and hash. The password method requires the administrator or user password for authentication, while Kerberos is utilized when the target system is part of a domain. Finally, fill in your username, password, and domain name.
Nessus credential configuration involves setting up authentication credentials to enable Nessus to perform authenticated scans on target systems. This allows Nessus to gather more detailed information about the target, resulting in more accurate and comprehensive vulnerability assessment reports  <br/>

If an attempt to run the scan results in a notification indicating insufficient privileges for the account used, it is likely due to the non-default administrator account being automatically added to the local group administrators without adequate access rights to system files and settings.

To resolve this issue, several additional steps need to be undertaken. While not overly complex, these steps do require some time.

To begin, return to the Windows VM and access the "Services" by clicking on the Windows button and searching for the term. Locate the "Remote Registry" and adjust its startup type to "Automatic," enabling remote connection to the system registry database for various operations, such as viewing registry keys and values.

Subsequently, locate the "User Account Control" and set the notification level to "Never notify," thereby preventing interruptions to the scan by user account control prompts.

Lastly, open the registry editor and navigate to the specific location to create a new DWord value. Expand the registry to the following order: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, Software, Microsoft, Windows, CurrentVersion, Policies, and System. Within the "System" folder, create a new DWord value named "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" ensuring the precise spelling to prevent the value from being disregarded. Edit the properties of the new value by changing the value data field from 0 to 1, thereby enabling the local account token filter policy to grant non-administrator accounts access to administrative resources when using remote procedure call.

Upon completing these steps, restart the computer to ensure the changes take effect.  <br/>
