<br />
In this section, we will outline the essential procedures for preparing your virtual machine (VM) for scanning. This involves optimizing security updates, installing all available updates, and disabling the firewall. These measures are critical to ensure that Nessus can effectively identify any vulnerabilities or weaknesses: <br/>

<br />
<br />
We must ensure that the virtual machine is on the same network as the machine that will be conducting the scan. Navigate to the network adapter option and select "attach to host" on the adapter, we encounter some problems with dhcp server which was off so we eneable it in File > Tools > Network Manager. Now we can ping our virtual machine from host: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next step after successful installation and compilation of plugins, it is time to configure our first scan. From the various options available in Nessus, we will select the basic network scan and configure the name and IP address of our VM with basic settings. While we wait for scan to finish we can observ informations about scan as we can see we Scan already detected one mediom Vulnerabilitie   <br/>

<br />
<br />
Upon selecting the medium vulnerability, Nessus provides detailed information regarding the identified vulnerability. For instance, that SMB Signing is not required, which can be exploited by attackers through man-in-the-middle attacks against the SMB server. Additionally, Nessus offers a solution to address this issue under the "Solution" section.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Let's proceed to the next phase by incorporating credentials into our saved Windows scan to gain more detailed information. Begin by accessing "My Scans" and selecting the saved scan, labeled "first." In the top-right corner, you will find an option to configure. Click on this to proceed. In the credentials section, choose "Windows" as our VM is Windows-based. When conducting a Windows credentials scan, various authentication methods are available, including password, Kerberos, hash, and hash. The password method requires the administrator or user password for authentication, while Kerberos is utilized when the target system is part of a domain. Finally, fill in your username, password, and domain name.
Nessus credential configuration involves setting up authentication credentials to enable Nessus to perform authenticated scans on target systems. This allows Nessus to gather more detailed information about the target, resulting in more accurate and comprehensive vulnerability assessment reports  <br/>

<br />
<br />
If an attempt to run the scan results in a notification indicating insufficient privileges for the account used, it is likely due to the non-default administrator account being automatically added to the local group administrators without adequate access rights to system files and settings. To resolve this issue, several additional steps need to be undertaken. To begin, return to the Windows VM and access the "Services" by clicking on the Windows button and searching for the term. Locate the "Remote Registry" and adjust its startup type to "Automatic," enabling remote connection to the system registry database for various operations, such as viewing registry keys and values. Subsequently, locate the "User Account Control" and set the notification level to "Never notify," thereby preventing interruptions to the scan by user account control prompts. Lastly, open the registry editor and navigate to the specific location to create a new DWord value. Expand the registry to the following order: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, Software, Microsoft, Windows, CurrentVersion, Policies, and System. Within the "System" folder, create a new DWord value named "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" ensuring the precise spelling to prevent the value from being disregarded. Edit the properties of the new value by changing the value data field from 0 to 1, thereby enabling the local account token filter policy to grant non-administrator accounts access to administrative resources when using remote procedure call. Upon completing these steps, restart the computer to ensure the changes take effect.  <br/>

<br />
We will introduce vulnerable software into the system. As my current virtual machine lacks internet connectivity, I will access the devices, navigate to network settings, and modify the "attach to" parameter from a host-only adapter to a bridge adapter to establish internet connectivity. Subsequently, we will procure outdated software, exemplified by the installation of a 2020 version of Chrome, an older version of 7zip, and a 2021 version of Minecraft. We will subsequently delve into a detailed discussion regarding these specific software versions. And make another scan.  <br/>
