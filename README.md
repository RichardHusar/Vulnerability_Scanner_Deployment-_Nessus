<h1>Vulnerability Scanner Deployment Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves deploying the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner within a VirtualBox virtual machine on a host system running Windows 10. The purpose of this deployment is to create a controlled environment for scanning and identifying potential vulnerabilities within a network or system. Throughout the project, best practices for security and ethical use of vulnerability scanning tools will be adhered to. Additionally, considerations for network and system performance will be taken into account to ensure the scanning process does not disrupt the host or other networked devices.

The project aims to provide hands-on experience with deploying and using a vulnerability scanner in a virtualized environment, while also gaining insight into the importance of identifying and addressing potential security risks.

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Virtual Box</b> 
- <b>Nessus</b>

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
Create a new virtual machine within VirtualBox and configure the necessary settings such as memory, CPU, and network adapters: <br/>

<br />
Installing Windows 10 operating system as the guest OS within the VirtualBox virtual machine:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
In this section, we will outline the essential procedures for preparing your virtual machine (VM) for scanning. This involves optimizing security updates, installing all available updates, and disabling the firewall. These measures are critical to ensure that Nessus can effectively identify any vulnerabilities or weaknesses: <br/>

<br />
<br />
We must ensure that the virtual machine is on the same network as the machine that will be conducting the scan. Navigate to the network adapter option and select "attach to host" on the adapter, we encounter some problems with dhcp server which was off so we eneable it in File > Tools > Network Manager. Now we can ping our virtual machine from host. <br/>
